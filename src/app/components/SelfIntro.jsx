          Heylo! I'm V Ranadheer, a final-year CS student who lives at the intersection of design and development. 
          Every line of code I write and every pixel I craft is an experiment in creative problem-solving. 
          I'm on a journey to explore what it means to be a developer – one creative and innovative solution at a time.
          Trying to think and solve problems at a higher level.
