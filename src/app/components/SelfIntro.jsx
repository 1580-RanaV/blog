        Hi! I'm V. Ranadheer, a final-year CS student passionate about the intersection 
        of design and development. Every line of code I write and every pixel I design reflects my commitment
        to creative problem-solving. I'm on a journey to discover what it truly means to be a developer
        — crafting innovative solutions one step at a time, while continuously striving to think and solve problems at a higher level.
