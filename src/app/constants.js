  title: "Product Designer",
  description: "A hands-on builder who designs with restraint and ships with intention. I build products, interfaces, and systems that sit between design and engineering. I like things that are minimal, intentional, and fast; whether it is a frontend flow or a visual identity. I treat code like a design tool; it shapes experience, not just function. I love designing and building what I create.",
